## Problem:
> Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram. Developers pushed the latest version of their code in a zip file located in a public S3 Bucket.

> You have been tasked with deploying the application, along with the necessary supporting software into its matching infrastructure.

> This needs to be done in an automated fashion so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.
